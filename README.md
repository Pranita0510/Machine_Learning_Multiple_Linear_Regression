ðŸ¤– Machine Learning Model:

This Jupyter Notebook presents a complete implementation of machine learning models on a structured and preprocessed dataset. It serves as a practical guide to building, training, and evaluating models using Python's popular data science libraries.

ðŸ“Œ Key Steps Covered:

*Importing Libraries-

Utilizes pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, and scikit-learn for data handling and modeling.

*Loading Dataset-

Reads the cleaned dataset and displays basic structure and statistics.

*Train-Test Split-

Splits the data into training and testing sets using train_test_split from Scikit-learn.

*Model Implementation-

Implements machine learning models such as:

1)Logistic Regression

2)Decision Tree Classifier

3)Random Forest Classifier

*Model Training and Prediction-

Trains the models on training data and makes predictions on test data.

*Model Evaluation-

Evaluates model performance using:

Accuracy Score

Confusion Matrix

Classification Report

Visualizations (if any)

*Performance Comparison-

Compares multiple models to identify the most effective one based on evaluation metrics.

ðŸ›  Requirements:

Python 3.x

Libraries: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn, jupyter

ðŸ’¡ Use Case:

This notebook is ideal for:

Beginners learning how to implement and evaluate ML models

Students working on machine learning projects

Demonstrating a full ML pipeline in practice.
